A Flask application that let the user save notes with text (with markdown support), images, youtube links and mp3 files.

The user can also set a category for each note. 

The applications also come with an API that I will use to develop an Android app for this website. The API will be based on a token authorization, based on some example from the internet (http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/restful-authentication-with-flask)

I will also use peewee (http://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to handle all the DB stuff in Flask


Prototype of DB

Users

Id    Email    HashedPassword    Token    TokenExpirationDate    Banned


Notes

Id    UserId    LastEdit    Title    Body    Image(base64)    Mp3FileLocation(randomName)   publicId    category(int)    hidden


Categories

Id    UserId    Name



The website will be fully responsive. I won't use Bootstrap, or that's what I hope. 

The user will be able to register, login, logout and edit and delete notes. Deleting a note won't delete in permanently but will put it in something like a recycle bin.
